ABOUT
     dsblogoutmgr is a Qt utility that allows you to leave your current window
     manager-session, reboot, suspend or shutdown your system. Furthermore, it
     supports time-controlled shutdown.

INSTALLATION
     # git clone https://github.com/mrclksr/dsblogoutmgr
     # cd dsblogoutmgr && qmake && make && make install

USAGE
     dsblogoutmgr [-l <logout command>] [-r <reboot command>] [-s <shutdown
     command>] [-S <suspend command>]

OPTIONS
     -l      Defines the logout command. Default “fluxbox exit”

     -r      Defines the reboot command. Default “shutdown -r now”

     -s      Defines the shutdown command. Default “shutdown -p now”

     -S      Defines the suspend command. Default “acpiconf -s 3”


SETUP
     Commands for the actions can also be defined in
     ~/.config/DSB/dsblogoutmgr/config using variable=value pairs by setting
     the variables logout, shutdown, reboot, and suspend.  Commands containing
     white spaces must be enclosed in double quotes. If an action is defined
     on the command line, it is used instead of the one defined in
     ~/.config/DSB/dsblogoutmgr/config.

   Permissions
     In order to be able to execute shutdown as regular user, you have to be
     member of the operator group:

     # pw groupmod operator -m yourusername

     If you want to be able to suspend your system as regular user, you can
     use sudo(8).  Add

     %wheel  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/acpiconf *

     to /usr/loca/etc/sudoers, and define the suspend action accordingly by
     using the -S flag on the command line, or set

     suspend = "sudo acpiconf -s 3"

     in ~/.config/DSB/dsblogoutmgr/config
